\titledquestion{Which Sort?}

Given a sequence
\[A=\langle 4,10,18,15,5,1,5,14,7,7\rangle,\]
we have performed some different sorting algorithms on it, during which some intermediate results are printed. Note that the steps you see below are \textbf{not} necessarily consecutive steps in the algorithm, but they are guaranteed to be in the correct order.

For each group of steps, guess (\(\surd\)) what the algorithm is. The algorithm might be one among the following choices:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Insertion-sort, implemented in the way that avoids swapping elements
  \item Bubble-sort, which stops immediately when no swap happens during one iteration
  \item Merge-sort
  \item Quick-sort, with pivot chosen to be \(A_l\) when partitioning a subarray \(A_l,\cdots,A_r\).
\end{itemize}

% On the correct choice, replace `\choice' with `\CorrectChoice'.
