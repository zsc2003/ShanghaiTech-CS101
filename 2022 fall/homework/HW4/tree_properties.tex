\begin{parts}
    \part[2] The \textbf{children} of the \textbf{root node} with their \textbf{degree} respectively.
    \begin{solution}
        %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
        % Replace `\vspace{2in}' with your answer.
        %\vspace{1in}
        B, J

        deg(B)=2, deg(J)=3
        %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    \end{solution}
    \part[2] All \textbf{leaf nodes} in the forest with their \textbf{depth} if we remove A and the node with the lexicographically smallest character in a tree is taken as the root node.
    \begin{solution}
        %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
        % Replace `\vspace{2in}' with your answer.
        %\vspace{1in}
        D, F, G, I, L, O, Q, R, S, T

        height(T) = 1

        height(D) = height(I) = height(L) = 2

        height(F) = height(G) = height(O) = height(S) = 3

        height(Q) = height(R) = 4
        %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    \end{solution}
    \part[2] The \textbf{height} of the tree.
    \begin{solution}
        %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
        % Replace `\vspace{2in}' with your answer.
        %\vspace{1in}
        height = max\{depth(v) | v \(\in\) V\} = 5

        so height = 5
        %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    \end{solution}

    \newpage

    \part[2] The \textbf{ancestors} of R. 
    \begin{solution}
        %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
        % Replace `\vspace{2in}' with your answer.
        %\vspace{1in}
        R, P, N, M, J, A
        %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    \end{solution}
    \part[2] The \textbf{descendants} of L.

        %\vspace{1in}
        L
        %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    \end{solution}
    \part[2] The \textbf{path} from E to S.
    \begin{solution}
        %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
        % Replace `\vspace{2in}' with your answer.
