\titledquestion{Topological Sort}

    Given the following DAG, run topological sort with a queue. Write down the vertex you select and update the in-degree \texttt{ind[i]} of all vertices in each iteration.  
	
	\textit{Note: When pushing several vertices into the queue at the same time, push them alphabetically. You are NOT required to show your queue at each step.}
