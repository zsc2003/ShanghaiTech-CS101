# Background

You are goint to hack the quicksort algorithm we provided. In other words, you need to generate the initial array which results in quicksort's worst-case running time $\Theta(n^2)$, and then run for more than 1 second on OJ.

# Description

Many many years later, you become a TA of course 101SC 4202Fall, and Flash is one of your students. One day, he write [`quicksort.cpp`](file://quicksort.cpp) (You can find it in Piazza Resources) which implements the quicksort algorithm with 3 different pivot strategies, all of which are taught in Lecture 7 Slides:

```cpp
// Pivot Strategy #1: always choose the first element as the pivot
int* chooseFirst(int* first, [[maybe_unused]] int* last) {
    return first;
};

// Pivot Strategy #2: choose a random element as the pivot
int* chooseRandom(int* first, int* last) {
    int n = last - first;
    int pos = std::uniform_int_distribution<>(0, n - 1)(engine);
    return first + pos;
};

// Pivot Strategy #3: choose the median of three random elements as the pivot
int* medianRandom(int* first, int* last) {
    int n = last - first;
    int pos1 = std::uniform_int_distribution<>(0, n - 1)(engine);
    int pos2 = std::uniform_int_distribution<>(0, n - 2)(engine);
    int pos3 = std::uniform_int_distribution<>(0, n - 3)(engine);
    pos3 += pos3 >= pos2;
    pos3 += pos3 >= pos1;
    pos2 += pos2 >= pos1;
    // sort first[pos1] <= first[pos2] <= first[pos3]
    if (first[pos2] < first[pos1])
        std::swap(pos2, pos1);
    if (first[pos3] < first[pos2])
        std::swap(pos3, pos2);
    if (first[pos2] < first[pos1])
        std::swap(pos2, pos1);
    // the median first+pos2 is the pivot
    return first + pos2;
};
```

However, you are not satisfied with this algorithm. No matter which pivot strategy is used, the time complexity is average-case $\Theta(n\log n)$ but worstcase $\Theta(n^2)$. You know exactly the pivot strategy `pivotStrategy` and the `seed` of the random number generator `engine`, both of which will be adjusted in each testcase. Therefore you can perfectly predict which pivot is chosen each time. Then you can hack this algorithm with a certain array that can reach the worst case. Your task is to output such an array, which then becomes the input of [`quicksort.cpp`](file://quicksort.cpp) and makes it run for more than 1 second on OJ.

# Format

## Input
Two integers: `pivotStrategy` and `seed`, where
- `pivotStrategy`$\in\{1,2,3\}$ indicates the pivot strategy that quicksort uses.
- $0\le$ `seed` $\le 2147483647$ is the seed of random number genrator.

## Output
One line, the array of length $n=10^5$ that can make the quicksort TLE. The numbers should be separated by spaces.

# Samples

For certain sample input, your output doesn't need to be the same as the sample output. You can get full points as long as you makes the quicksort run for more than 1 second on OJ.

[hack_sample2.out](file://hack_sample2.out)

[hack_sample3.out](file://hack_sample3.out)

```input1
1 123456789
```

```output1
Too large. See hack_sample1.out
(You can find it in Piazza Resources)
```

```input2
2 123456789
```

```output2
Too large. See hack_sample2.out
(You can find it in Piazza Resources)
```

```input3
3 123456789
```

```output3
Too large. See hack_sample3.out
(You can find it in Piazza Resources)
```

# Limitation
Time limit 1s, memory limit 256MB for each test case.


# OJ Compile Directive

```shellscript
g++ foo.cc -o foo -std=c++20 -Wall -Wpedantic -Wextra -Werror -DONLINE_JUDGE -fmax-errors=3 -fdiagnostics-color=always
```

# About Local Test and Submission

Suppose the code you will submit to OJ is `hack.cpp`.

Download [`quicksort.cpp`](file://quicksort.cpp) and put it in the same directory with `hack.cpp`.

Create a file `hack.in` which contains `pivotStrategy` and `seed`.

Then you can test your code locally. For example, if using Windows Powershell, run the following commands:

```
if (!(g++ hack.cpp -o hack -std=c++20 -Wall -Wpedantic -Wextra -Werror -fmax-errors=3 -fdiagnostics-color=always)) {
if (!(cat hack.in | .\hack > hack.out)) {
if (!(g++ quicksort.cpp -o quicksort -std=c++20 -Wall -Wpedantic -Wextra -Werror -fmax-errors=3 -fdiagnostics-color=always "-Wl,--stack=268435456")) {
cat hack.in | .\quicksort }}}
```

If you have seen that the quicksort algorithm  takes a relatively long time (maybe >0.5 seconds, depending on your CPU, memory, etc.), then probably you successfully hacked this algorithm.

Just submit `hack.cpp` to OJ.
