# Background

Have you ever heard or played this game beforeðŸ˜‰

The problem setting is slightly modified from this real-world game.

# Description

Akinator plays with millions of people every day. The procedure is:

1. The player initially thinks of a well-known character (both real-world or virtual is OK).
2. Akinator asks a yes-or-no question, for example, "Is it a virtual character?"
3. The player answer Yes or No truthfully according to what he/she thinks.
4. Repeat 2. 3. , until when Akinator can determine what the player thinks.

There are $n$ characters that players probably asks. Akinator divides these characters into $m$ categories.

The $i$-th category is denoted as $(f_i,c_i)$, where

- $f_i$ is the frequency, i.e. every character in this category will be asked $f_i$ times per day.
- $c_i$ is the count, i.e. $c_i$ characters are in this category. Note that $n=\sum\limits_{i=1}^{m}c_i$.

Akinator is so tired, therefore he want to ask questions as few as possible. Your task is to help him compute
$$
\min_Q\sum_{j=1}^{n} Q(j)f_{t_j}
$$
where $Q(j)$ means the number of questions Akinator needs to ask before he determines that the player thinks of the $j$-th character, and the $j$-th character belongs to the $t_j$-th category.

In other words, this is the minimized sum of frequency of questions Akinator needs to ask per day.

# Format

## Input
First line is an integer $m$.

For the following $m$ lines, each line is two integers $f_i,c_i$.

It is ensured that $1\le m,f_i,c_i\le 10^5.$

(update 12/7 15:20) It is not ensured that all $f_i$ are distinct.

## Output
The answer. Note that it may be very large, so please use `long long`.

# Hints & Sample Explanation

For the first sample, suppose there are $6$ characters indexed from $1$ to $6$:

- Trump, which is thought of $7$ times per day.
- Biden, which is thought of $1$ times per day.
- Obama, which is thought of $1$ times per day.
- Hillary, which is thought of $2$ times per day.
- Nahida, which is thought of $3$ times per day.
- HuTao, which is thought of $3$ times per day.

One of the optimal way for Akinator to ask questions is:

![sample.png](images/t2.png)

And the answer can be computed by
$$
\sum_{j=1}^{n} Q(j)f_{t_j}=1\times7+4\times1+4\times1+3\times2+3\times3+3\times3=39
$$
or computed by the sum of frequency of questions
$$
17+10+4+2+6=39
$$
Note that this can be computed by Huffman Coding (think about why). 

If you directly run the Huffman Coding algorithm which takes $\Theta(n\log n)$ time (brute-force), you are expected to get $50$ points.

If you can come up with an $\Theta(\sum\limits_{i=1}^m(\log c_i)\cdot\log m)$ or even  $\Theta(m\log m+\sum\limits_{i=1}^m(\log c_i))$ algorithm, you are expected to get $100$ points.

Suppose we have $(f_i,c_i)=(1,100000)$. If we use brute-force Huffman tree building, then we will merge $50000$ times at first, which is very slow. However, we can directly infer that there will be $(2, 50000),(4, 25000)$, and so on, which is much faster.
