# Description
Given the post-order traversal sequence of a binary search tree (BST), your goal is to construct the BST.

# Format

## Input
The first line is an integer $n$, the size of this BST. $1\le n\le 10^6$.

The second line is $n$ integers $v_1,v_2,\cdots,v_n$ representing the post order traversal sequence, where $v_i$ is the value of the $i$-th node. It is ensured that all $v_i$ are distinct. $0\le v_i\le 10^9$.

## Output
If such BST does not exist, print `Not exist`.

Otherwise, print $n-1$ integers $p_1,p_2,\cdots,p_{n-1}$, where the $p_i$-th node is the parent of the $i$-th node.

# Samples

```input1
9
1 3 5 4 2 9 8 7 6
```

```output1
5 4 4 5 9 7 8 9
```

```input2
9
30 10 50 40 20 90 80 70 60
```

```output2
Not exist
```

# Hint

You can find an $O(n^2)$ algorithm in CS101 2023Fall Midterm. It is expected to get 50 points on OJ, because $1\le n\le 10^3$ in the first subtask.

Think about how to optimize it to $O(n\log n)$ or even $O(n)$. An $O(n\log n)$ algorithm is enough to get 100 points on OJ.
