## Description

Given a weighted undirected graph $G = (V, E)$ and an integer $k$, where some edges are defined as "special" in the graph, each edge can be represented as a quadruple: $e_i = (u_i, v_i, w_i, s_i)$.

- $u_i$ and $v_i$ represent the indices of the vertices connected by the edge.
- $w_i$ represents the weight of the edge.
- $s_i$ indicates whether the edge is special ($s_i = 1$ means it's special, and $s_i = 0$ means it's not special).

For convenience, let's define some notations:
- $E_s$ denotes the set of special edges.
- $E_n$ denotes the set of non-special edges.
- $|V| = n$, $|E| = m$, $|E_s| = m_1$, $|E_n| = m_2$.

We want to find a spanning tree that satisfies the following requirements:

1. It contains exactly $k$ special edges in the graph.
2. Among all spanning trees satisfying the first requirement, it has the minimal weight.

## Input Format
The first line contains three integers $n(=|V|),m(=|E|)$, and $k$, representing the number of vertices, the number of edges, and the required number of special edges, respectively.

The next $m$ lines is given by: $i$-th line contains four integers $u_i,v_i,w_i,s_i$, which means it connected $u_i$ and $v_i$, of $w_i$ weight and whether it is special by $s_i$.

**The index of vertex starts from $1$!**

## Output Format
A single line containing the total edge weight of the desired spanning tree.

## Notes

- For $100\%$ of the data, $n \leq 10^5$ and $m \leq 5\times 10^5$, $0\leq k<n,m_1,m_2 \geq n-1$, guaranteed there exists at least one required spanning tree.
- All edge weights are positive integers within the range $[1, 10000]$.
