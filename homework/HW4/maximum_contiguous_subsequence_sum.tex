\titledquestion{Maximum Contiguous Subsequence Sum}[8]

Given an array $\langle a_1,\cdots,a_n\rangle$ of length $n$ with both \textbf{positive} and \textbf{negative} elements, we will design a \textbf{divide and conquer} algorithm to find the maximum contiguous subsequence sum of $a$. We say $m$ is the  maximum contiguous subsequence sum of $a$ such that for any integer pair $(l,r)$ ($1 \le l \le r \le n$), 
$$
m \ge \sum_{i = l} ^ r a_i.
$$
The time complexity should be $\Theta(n \log n)$.

\paragraph{Algorithm Design:} 
after divide the sequence into two parts from the middle

the maximum contiguous subsequence may have three possible location distributions
\begin{enumerate}
	\item the whole subsequence is in the left part
	\item the whole subsequence is in the right part
	\item the subsequence is in both left part and right part, and it get through the middle
\end{enumerate}

\iffalse
so we need to maintain four variables during the divide and conquer

they are the $maxn, lmax, rmax, sum$

\begin{itemize}
	\item $sum$ , it is the easist one, just the sum of all numbers of the subsequence,
	and we can maintain it by adding left-subsequence's $sum+$ right-subsequence's $sum$

	\item $lmax$, it is the maximum contiguous subsequence start from the left point of the subsequence,
	there are two possibilites:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item it may be the left subsequence's $lmax$
		\item it may be the whole left sequence with part of the right-subsequence
	\end{itemize}
	
	and we can maintain it by acquiring the maximum one bewteen left-subsequence's $lmax$ and (left-subsequence's $sum+$ right-subsequence's $lmax$	)

	\item $rmax$, it is similar to the $lmax$,
	so just let $rmax=max\{$ right-subsequence's $rmax$ , (right-subsequence's $sum+$ left-subsequence's $rmax)\}$
	
	\item $maxn$, it is the maximum contiguous subsequence of the whole subsequence,
	from the discuss at the begining, we can maintain it by letting 
	
	$maxn=max\{ left-subsequence's \ maxn , right-subsequence's \ maxn , left-subsequence's \ rmax \ +\  right-subsequence's\ lmax\}$
	
\end{itemize}

and at last, we only need to know the $maxn$ of the whole sequence.

\fi

and for the first two situations,
for the left-subsequence and right-subsequence, they have the samilar situation above

and for the third situation, we just need to start at the middle point, expand to the left and right respectively,
and find the maximum contiguous subsequence respectively, then sum them up.

so we can recursively divide and conquer the problem
\paragraph{Pseudocode :}
$left$ and $right$ are indecies of the leftmost and rightmost elements in given array $a$ respectively.
\begin{algorithm}[H]
	\begin{algorithmic}[1]
		\Function {get\_max\_contiguous\_subsequence}{$a$, $left$, $right$}
		\If {$right == left$} 
		\State \Return max(0,a[left])
		\EndIf
		\State $mid\gets \lfloor (left + right)/2 \rfloor$
		\State $left\_subsequence\gets get\_max\_contiguous\_subsequence(a,left,mid)$
		\State $right\_subsequence\gets get\_max\_contiguous\_subsequence(a,mid+1,right)$

		define sum=0,lmax=0

		for(i from mid to left):

		\ \ \ \ \	sum+=a[i]

		\ \ \ \ \ 	lmax=max(lmax,sum)

		similarly, define sum=0,rmax=0

		for(i from (mid+1) to right):

		\ \ \ \ \ 	sum+=a[i]

		\ \ \ \ \ 	rmax=max(rmax,sum)
		\State $mid\_subsequence\gets (lmax+rmax)$

		\State $maxn\gets max\{left\_subsequence, right\_subsequence, mid\_subsequence\}$
		\State \Return maxn
		\EndFunction
	\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\paragraph{Time Complexity Analysis:}
During each recursion, the calculation of $mid$ and comparison can be done in constant time, 
and getting the $lmax$ and $rmax$ takes the time of the sequence's length, which is exactly $\Theta(n)$. We will take both half part of the sequence, thus there are two times of each subproblem.
$$T(n) = 2\cdot T(\frac{n}{2})+\Theta(n)$$
Therefore, by the Master Theorem,

$a=2,b=2,\log_{b}{a}=1=d$, so $T(n) = \Theta(nlogn)$.
