\titledquestion{The highest DSU I've ever seen}

In the following tasks, you can label the nodes by whatever mark you want.
We only care about the tree structure.

\begin{parts}
	\part[2] Plot a union tree of $15$ nodes with minimum height.
	The tree was generated by disjoint-set-union with union-by-height.\\
	\part[2] Plot a union tree of $16$ nodes with maximum height.
	The tree was generated by disjoint-set-union with union-by-height.\\
\end{parts}

\begin{solution}

for (a)\\\\

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
%		\item Why not tikz?\\
\begin{tikzpicture}
	\Tree [.1
		2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15
	]
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{enumerate}


for (b)\\\\
\begin{enumerate}[(b)]
\begin{tikzpicture}
	\Tree [.1
		2
